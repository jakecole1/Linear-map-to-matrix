During my second course in linear algebra, there were many times which I would have a linear map which I would want to turn into a matrix. Often, both the maps and the bases I was working with were complex, which made calculating the matrix representation time consuming and error prone. I decided to use my linear algebra and Python skills to create an interactive website for turning a linear map and basis into a matrix. The app is mainly powered by Flask and Sympy (a LaTeX powered python library).
