# Linear Map to Matrix Converter
## Introduction
During my second course in linear algebra, I encountered a frequent need to convert linear maps into matrices. This task became particularly challenging when working with complex maps and bases, leading to time-consuming and error-prone calculations. To address this, I developed an interactive website that simplifies this process by leveraging my knowledge in linear algebra and Python programming.

## Features
Interactive Web Interface: Easy-to-use interface for inputting linear maps and bases.
Complex Calculations Simplified: Specifically designed to handle complex maps and bases with ease.
Powered by Flask and Sympy: Utilizes Flask for the web framework and Sympy (a LaTeX powered Python library) for accurate and efficient mathematical computations.
Installation
To install and run the Linear Map to Matrix Converter on your local machine, follow these steps:

## Usage
Launch the Flask server:
Copy code, then
open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input your linear map and basis.
The website will process your input and display the corresponding matrix.
